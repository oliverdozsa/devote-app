<h4>FAQ</h4>

  <nb-accordion-item>
    <nb-accordion-item-header>How does it work?</nb-accordion-item-header>
    <nb-accordion-item-body>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Here are the steps in a nutshell
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your first authenticate with the server and start the voting session. This is analogous to paper voting: you
          show
          your identification to the voting commission in order to make sure you won't vote twice. You get your voting
          paper after that.
        </li>
        <li>
          You create a concealed voting request. This request will contain information about where to deliver the voting
          token.
          The concealed request cannot be read by the server. You send this to the server for signing. It's like putting
          your vote in
          an envelope that has carbon-copy on the inside. Then bringing this envelope to the voting commission where
          they sign it. When they
          put their signature on it, thanks to the carbon-copy, the signature will go to the vote too, but the commission
          won't be able to see
          it as it's inside the envelope.
        </li>
        <li>
          You become anonymous. From the concealed request and the signature from step 2, you create
          the revealed request and the (revealed) signature for it. You present the server the revealed request and
          signature, and ask
          it to deliver the vote token. With the vote token in your possession you cast your vote.<br/>
          To stick with the paper voting, it's like putting on a mask, get the vote paper from the envelope and give it
          to the commission.
          They'll accept the vote as a valid one (since they'll see their signature on it), but they won't know who you
          are because there's a mask on your face.
        </li>

    <nb-accordion-item-header>What networks are supported?</nb-accordion-item-header>
    <nb-accordion-item-body>
      Currently only Stellar, but support for other networks are on the way.

  <nb-accordion-item>
    <nb-accordion-item-header>How much does a vote cost?</nb-accordion-item-header>
    <nb-accordion-item-body>
      An example: 500 participants vote costs less than 10XLMs on the Stellar network. Initial cost is higher, but after
      a voting is ended, unused resources are refunded.

  <nb-accordion-item>
    <nb-accordion-item-header>I want to try creating a voting without costing money. Is it possible?</nb-accordion-item-header>
    <nb-accordion-item-body>
      Yes, absolutely. When creating a voting switch "use test network" on. You can use your own testnet account, or
      let DeVote generate one for you. The voting will be created entirely on the testnet. Please note, that testnets are
      cleared periodically, so expect to things break after some time.
